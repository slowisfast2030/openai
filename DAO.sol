/**
This contract represents a simple DAO that allows its members to submit and vote on proposals. 

In this contract, members of the DAO are only able to submit proposals, and voting is limited to members only. Each proposal has a vote count that is incremented each time a member votes, and is approved when the vote count reaches a minimum threshold. The minimum threshold is determined by the `minVotesToApprove` variable, which is set at contract creation.

The contract also allows for the addition and removal of members from the DAO, and keeps track of the total number of members.

This is just a basic example of a DAO. In reality, the complexity of a DAO contract would depend on the specific needs and goals of the organization it represents.
