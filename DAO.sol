/**
This contract represents a simple DAO that allows its members to submit and vote on proposals. 

Here's what the behavior of the contract would look like in practice:

1. First, we deploy the contract to the blockchain, specifying the `maxVotesPerMember` and `minVotesToApprove` parameters. These parameters are passed to the constructor at deployment time, and govern the behavior of the DAO.

2. Next, we add members to the DAO by calling the `addMember` function, passing in the Ethereum addresses of the new members.

3. Once we have members in the DAO, they can submit proposals by calling the `submitProposal` function, passing in a description of the proposal.

4. Other members can then vote on the proposal by calling the `vote` function, passing in the ID of the proposal they're voting on.

5. If the proposal receives enough votes to meet the `minVotesToApprove` threshold, it becomes "approved", meaning that the proposal can be enacted.

6. Once a proposal is approved, the submitter (and potentially other members) can carry out the actions specified in the proposal.

7. Members can be removed from the DAO by calling the `removeMember` function, passing in the Ethereum address of the member to be removed.

Overall, this contract provides a simple and decentralized way for a group of people to govern themselves and make decisions. By using the blockchain and Web3 technologies, we can create a trustless and transparent organization that is not controlled by any single individual or entity.
